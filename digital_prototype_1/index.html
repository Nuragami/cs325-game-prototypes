<h2>Space Duel 2</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fast paced two player death match.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Cowboy vs Asteriod...literally
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Action arcade shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The main experience to take away from this game is just to have a fun time. Multiplayer games are meant to be enjoyed by lots of people and should be fast and memorable.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players will fight to the death by shooting at each other in space. Players can fly around to avoid enemy fire as well as fire back. Players will either control the cowboy or the asteriod. Controls for the cowboy are the WASD keys for movement and 1 key for fire. Controls for the asteriod are the arrow keys for movement and the 0 key for fire.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The prototype is evaluating smooth movement and shooting projectiles.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The cowboy hat is pretty unique...as well as an asteriod shooting projectiles.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in space where a cowboy (least is hat) is in a endless duel with an asteriod.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The cowboy hat is lonely that the asteriod stole the actual cowboy. Seeking revenge, the cowboy hat must rescue the actual cowboy from the evil asteriod. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is for all ages of both genders.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Playtime is anywhere from 3 secs to 3 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The most effective strategy is to dodge the projectiles.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets are original. Made via Piskel.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
There are space shooters on the Phaser websites, however I did not really use or borrow any of the templates. The prototype was original..I would hope.
